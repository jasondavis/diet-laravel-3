Everytime a Laravel-based application boots up, PHP has to fetch hundreds of files and parse them.\r\n\r\nTo improve performance of web applications, many developers utilize PHP op-code caching extensions such as APC, XCache and eAccelerator.\r\n\r\nRegardless of whether op-code caching is enabled or not, you can replace the traditional `laravel.php` with a different Laravel bootstrap file named `laravel_boot.php` (which acts as a wrapper around `laravel_lite.php`) to further boost the performance of your application.\r\n\r\nThe file `laravel_lite.php` is the result of merging commonly used Laravel and Symfony class files. Comments and other code decorations have been removed to boost PHP parsing. Additionally, some features (like command-line, artisan) have been deliberately stripped away since they are irrelevant in the CGI mode. Therefore, using the highly condensed and optimized `laravel_lite.php` would greatly reduce the number of files being included and drastically improve PHP parsing speed.\r\n\r\n## Getting started\r\n\r\nCopy the two files `laravel_boot.php` and `laravel_lite.php` to your `laravel/` folder.\r\n\r\nOpen the `public/index.php` file. Find the line below:\r\n\r\n```php\r\nrequire path('sys').'laravel.php'; \r\n```\r\n\r\nReplace the above line with this:\r\n\r\n```php\r\nrequire path('sys').'laravel_boot.php';\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What's removed\r\n\r\nThe diet version of Laravel does not contain Artisan and other command-line based features. These modules were deliberately stripped away to further optimize loading time of the web application. If you need to use the Artisan tool, switch back to regular `laravel.php` temporarily.\r\n\r\n## Feedback\r\n\r\nRants, raves and bug reports are welcome.\r\n\r\nCopyright Taylor Otwell [http://laravel.com/](http://laravel.com/)\r\n\r\nPortions Copyright Max Ehsan [http://laravelbook.com/](http://laravelbook.com/)","tagline":"Laravel 3 on crash-diet!"}
