Therefore, using the highly condensed and optimized `laravel_lite.php` would greatly reduce the number of files being included and drastically improve PHP parsing speed.\r\n\r\n## Getting started\r\n\r\nCopy the two files `laravel_boot.php` and `laravel_lite.php` to your `laravel/` folder.\r\n\r\nOpen the `public/index.php` file. Find the line below:\r\n\r\n```php\r\nrequire path('sys').'laravel.php'; \r\n```\r\n\r\nReplace the above line with this:\r\n\r\n```php\r\nrequire path('sys').'laravel_boot.php';\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What's removed\r\n\r\nThe diet version of Laravel does not contain Artisan and other command-line based features. These modules were deliberately stripped away to further optimize loading time of the web application. If you need to use the Artisan tool, switch back to regular `laravel.php` temporarily.\r\n\r\n## Feedback\r\n\r\nRants, raves and bug reports are welcome.\r\n\r\nCopyright Taylor Otwell [http://laravel.com/](http://laravel.com/)\r\n\r\nPortions Copyright Max Ehsan [http://laravelbook.com/](http://laravelbook.com/)","name":"Diet Laravel 3","tagline":"Laravel 3 on crash-diet!","google":"UA-37509080-3","note":"Don't delete this file!
